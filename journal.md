Finished the schematic!
It took some time since I was figuring out how I wanted to design the keyboard — what features to include, how to wire everything, and whether to go with a matrix or direct connection. In the end, I decided to go with direct connect.

I also finalized the keyboard’s shape, the number of keys, and their sizes.
